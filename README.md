# Web-Dev-Basics

In this project, I have created a few web pages which are linked together.

The (index.html) contains the basic html tags like p, h1, img, a, br, etc. 
Next page is (qs.html) which contains tags like table, ul, li, iframe,etc.
Final page is (form.html) which is displayed in the previous page using iframe tag. The form contains tags like form, label, input, select, textarea, etc.

For styling, basic CSS has been used. (index) uses external stylesheet and the other pages use style tag for writing internal CSS. Properties like color, background-color, border, padding, margin, etc. have been used.

The purpose of this project is to explore various HTML tags and CSS properties and get familiar with their syntax. I have followed W3Schools documentation to create this project.  I haven't used any comments as the code is pretty straightforward.
